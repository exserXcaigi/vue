## The Eight Lessons of Architecture
 
In his book, Quaroni proposes eight lessons that cover the main aspects of architectural design, from the initial idea to the final construction. Each lesson is illustrated with examples from his own projects and from other architects, both historical and contemporary. The lessons are:
 
1. **The Idea**: how to find a concept that guides the design and expresses the essence of the project.
2. **The Site**: how to analyze the physical and cultural context of the project and adapt the design to its conditions.
3. **The Plan**: how to organize the spaces and functions of the project and create a coherent and functional layout.
4. **The Section**: how to define the vertical relationships and dimensions of the project and create a sense of space and light.
5. **The Facade**: how to design the external appearance and expression of the project and create a dialogue with the surroundings.
6. **The Structure**: how to choose the appropriate structural system and materials for the project and integrate them with the design.
7. **The Construction**: how to translate the design into a feasible and efficient building process and coordinate the various technical aspects.
8. **The Criticism**: how to evaluate the quality and performance of the project and learn from its successes and failures.

## The Legacy of Quaroni
 
Quaroni's book is not only a valuable guide for architects, but also a reflection of his own career and philosophy. Quaroni was involved in many important projects in Italy and abroad, such as the EUR district in Rome, the Torre Velasca in Milan, the Gibellina church in Sicily, and the Tehran University campus in Iran. He was also a prominent figure in the Italian architectural culture, participating in debates, exhibitions, magazines, and associations. He taught at various universities, including Rome, Venice, Naples, Florence, and Palermo[^3^], where he influenced generations of students with his innovative and critical vision.
 
Quaroni's book is still relevant today, as it offers a comprehensive and original approach to architectural design that combines theory and practice, creativity and rationality, tradition and innovation. It is a book that teaches not only how to design a building, but also how to think as an architect.
