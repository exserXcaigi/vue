If you want to use external devices with Nuendo 6, such as keyboards or audio interfaces, you can use the Import Devices dialog to automate, assign parameters to, and control them. You can access this dialog from the Devices menu in Nuendo 6[^2^].

Nuendo 6 also introduces some new features that are exclusive to this version and not available in Cubase 7. One of them is the ADR Taker, which is a dedicated tool for recording Automatic Dialogue Replacement sessions. The ADR Taker allows you to set up cues, scripts, and video overlays for each marker on your timeline, and record multiple takes with pre- and post-roll options. You can also use the Rehearse mode to practice the cues with the talent, and the Swipe mode to quickly comp the best parts of each take. The ADR Taker can also generate reports and export them as PDF or XML files[^2^].
 
Another exclusive feature of Nuendo 6 is the Loudness Track, which is a special type of track that displays the loudness level of your project according to various standards, such as EBU R128 or ITU-R BS.1770. You can add a Loudness Track from the Project menu, and adjust its settings in the Inspector. The Loudness Track shows you the integrated, momentary, and short-term loudness values, as well as the loudness range and true peak level. You can also use the Loudness Lane to see the loudness curve of your project over time, and use the Loudness Meter to monitor the loudness level in real time[^3^].
 
Nuendo 6 also offers some enhancements for sound design and mixing, such as the new MixConsole, which features a flexible channel layout, full-screen mode, drag-and-drop functionality, and direct access to plug-ins and channel settings. The MixConsole also supports VCA faders, which allow you to control the level of multiple channels with a single fader, without affecting their relative levels. You can also use Link Groups to link parameters of multiple channels, such as mute, solo, or pan[^1^].
 
For sound design, Nuendo 6 includes a new plug-in called REVerence 2, which is an improved version of the convolution reverb that offers more impulse responses, a better user interface, and a new algorithm for creating realistic room simulations. You can also use the new Voxengo CurveEQ 3 plug-in to match the frequency spectrum of different audio tracks, or use the new Steinberg Bass Amp plug-in to add some punch and warmth to your bass sounds[^1^].
